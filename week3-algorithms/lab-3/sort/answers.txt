sort1 uses: Bubble Sort

How do you know?: it performed better than sort3 (selection sort) on sorted50000.txt which is reasonable since it doesn't check the sorted elements from back again

sort2 uses: Merge Sort

How do you know?: it was the fastest sorting the random50000.txt which indicates the algorithm used is non-quadratic

sort3 uses: Selection Sort

How do you know?: it was the slowest on sorted set of numbers since it iterates through the whole list anyways even if its sorted it doesnt hold a boolean variable that allows the function to break in case nothing is swapped
